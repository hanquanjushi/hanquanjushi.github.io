abstract = {Caching is crucial for accelerating data access, employed as a ubiquitous design in modern systems at many parts of computer systems. With increasing core count, and shrinking latency gap between cache and modern storage devices, hit-path scalability becomes increasingly critical. However, existing production in-memory caches often use list-based management with promotion on each cache hit, which requires extensive locking and poses a significant overhead for scaling beyond a few cores. Moreover, existing techniques for improving scalability either (1) only focus on the indexing structure and do not improve cache management scalability, or (2) sacrifice efficiency or miss-path scalability.Inspired by highly skewed data popularity and short-term hotspot stability in cache workloads, we propose Frozen-Hot, a generic approach to improve the scalability of list-based caches. FrozenHot partitions the cache space into two parts: a frozen cache and a dynamic cache. The frozen cache serves requests for hot objects with minimal latency by eliminating promotion and locking, while the latter leverages the existing cache design to achieve workload adaptivity. We built FrozenHot as a library that can be easily integrated into existing systems. We demonstrate its performance by enabling FrozenHot in two production systems: HHVM and RocksDB using under 100 lines of code. Evaluated using production traces from MSR and Twitter, FrozenHot improves the throughput of three baseline cache algorithms by up to 551%. Compared to stock RocksDB, FrozenHot-enhanced RocksDB shows a higher throughput on all YCSB workloads with up to 90% increase, as well as reduced tail latency.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
